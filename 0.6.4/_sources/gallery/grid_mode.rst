Grid mode
=========

Display layers in a grid using the `viewer.grid` API. When grid is enabled,
layers are automatically arranged - based on the stride, height, and width parameters -
in a grid of viewboxes linked to the main Camera and Dims. Viewer overlays such as
scale_bar can also be shown in a gridded manner.

    # setting the spacing to a value between 0 and 1 adds a padding between
    # viewboxes relative to their sizes. Setting to a value greater than 1
    # results in a padding of that exact number of pixels instead.
