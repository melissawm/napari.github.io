Options include:  * ``translucent``: voxel colors are blended along the view ray until     the result is opaque. * ``mip``: maximum intensity projection. Cast a ray and display the     maximum value that was encountered. * ``minip``: minimum intensity projection. Cast a ray and display the     minimum value that was encountered. * ``attenuated_mip``: attenuated maximum intensity projection. Cast a     ray and attenuate values based on integral of encountered values,     display the maximum value that was encountered after attenuation.     This will make nearer objects appear more prominent. * ``additive``: voxel colors are added along the view ray until     the result is saturated. * ``iso``: isosurface. Cast a ray until a certain threshold is     encountered. At that location, lighning calculations are     performed to give the visual appearance of a surface. * ``average``: average intensity projection. Cast a ray and display the     average of values that were encountered.  Returns ------- str     The current rendering mode  |                    |
