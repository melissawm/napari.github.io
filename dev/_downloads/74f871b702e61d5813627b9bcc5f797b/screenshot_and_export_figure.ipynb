        "\n# Comparison of Screenshot and Figure Export\n\nDisplay multiple layer types, add scale bar, and take a screenshot or export a\nfigure from a 'light' canvas. Then switch to a 'dark' canvas and display the\nscreenshot and figure. Compare the limits of each export method. The screenshot\nwill include the entire canvas, and results in some layers being clipped\nif it extends outside the canvas. This also means that screenshots will\nreflect the current zoom. In comparison, the `export_figure` will always\ninclude the extent of the layers and any other elements overlayed\non the canvas, such as the scale bar. Exported figures also move the scale bar\nto within the margins of the canvas.\n\nIn the final grid state shown below, the first row represents exported images. The first two show that zoom is not reflected in the exported figure. The final one shows how the exported figure adapts to change in the layer extent. In the second row are the screenshots, showing the fact that the entire canvas is captured and that zoom is preserved.\n\n.. tags:: visualization-advanced\n"
